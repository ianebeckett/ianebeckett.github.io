Where does WSL store my files?

TL;DR:
- WSL2 stores its files in a virtual hard drive (VHD) named ext4.vhdx.
- I found the VHD in D:\Users\<my username>\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState
    --AppData is a hidden file
- copy the VHD to a Windows machine
    --check the file format and capacity of any intermediate drives used for this transfer. My wsl VHD was about 50 GB. I used an HDD with 4 TB of space in NTFS format.
- install WSL2 on the Windows machine
- mount the VHD in powershell: $ wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04 --mount --vhd <path to the VHD>
    --I'm not 100% sure about the importance of the distro name, but this worked for me. See the wsl man pages for more info.
- on the Windows machine, run Ubuntu
- the root directory of your wsl files should be located in /mnt/wsl. You can now copy them elsewhere e.g. with cp

Before my Lenovo Yoga C940 died, it had survived nearly four years of hard, daily use.
The stylus charger no longer worked, and three columns of keys stopped working, but I always found fixes or workarounds for these minor issues.
a few weeks ago, it making a lot of noise. Every time I started the machine, one of the fanswould start humming loudly, like an angry bumblebee.
I ignored the problem for a few days, not wanting to deal with it at such a busy time. I tried slapping the thing a few times in hopes of dislodging what I assumed was a dust bunny caught in the fan blades.
Eventually, I decided to get rid of the noise for good. I cleared my desk, donned my grounded wrist strap, and pulled out my trusty iFixit tool kit.

I have a bit of experience with electronics. I worked for six years as an electronics technician. I had also assembled a couple of gaming computers from hand-picked parts.
When I had replaced the keyboard assembly a year ago, the only casualaties were the integrated webcam and a wobbly backspace key.
Surely, this simple procedure would be open-and-shut. In twenty minutes, I thought, I should be back to work.
Nevermind the fact that I was working bare-footed on a shag carpet.
I even had the herewithal to put on an ESD strap and clip it to my trash can.
I opened the device up. As I suspected, the fans were clogged with dust.
Not having any of compressed air canisters stored around, I had the fateful idea to use a toothbrush that I keep in my drawer.
Oops, I brushed some dust onto the motherboard. I'll just brush that off real quick.
All clean! now to screw everything back together, and... it doesn't turn on.
After removing and reseating everything, it still wouldn't power up.
A bit of problem isolation with a logic probe told me that the power supply button was working as intended. That could only mean one thing:
I had ESD'd the motherboard.

Just to be sure, I dropped my laptop off at the local computer repair store. I figured that they might be able to repair it on the cheap.
They confirmed that the motherboard was, in fact, dead. Worse still, their typical suppliers didn't have this specific one; it was only available from Lenovo.
The total cost to replace it, including parts and labor, would be $1,600 US.
I figured, at that price, I might as well just buy a new one. I asked the technician to move everything onto an external HDD for me.
Upon connecting the drive, we saw that it was encrypted by BitLocker, Microsoft's data full volume encryption featre. Luckily, I found the key on a microsoft.com account that I'd forgotten I had.
After unlocking the drive, we were easily able to copy over my Windows files, but I didn't see the files I had stored in WSL.
I wanted those files.a
Upon my asking where they might be, the technician paused with a puzzled look on his face. Then, in a flurry of inspiration, he slapped a sheet of paper on the counter and started rambling about Plan 9 and Bell Labs, all while scribbling long path names and connecting them haphazardly with criss-cross lines.
At this point, I was mentally preparing myself for the looming possibility that my files were unrecoverable.
After a few minutes, he paused to take a breath. "I don't know where I was going with that, Anyway, I'm not sure where those files are!"
At my request, the technician removed the SSD from my dead Lenovo and put it in an enclosure.
I thanked him for his help, stowed the drive in my backpack, and made the slow trip home.

Not quite ready to give up, I started searching for my files every way I knew how.
I borrowed an old Dell from a family member who lived nearby.
I plugged in my drive and started clicking though the files with file explorer.
I Googled. I searched the files. I RTFManpages, but I still couldn't find the files.
Even ChatGPT didn't have an answer. Well, it had an answer, but it was basically irrelavent to my problem. Despite several attempts to twist my words into a more effective prompt, it kept giving answers that were truthy, but ultimately useless.
(This StackExchange post)[https://superuser.com/questions/1185033/what-is-the-home-directory-on-windows-subsystem-for-linux] led me closest to the right solution. Armed with the information therein, I managed to find a virtual drive called ext4.vhdl in D:\Users\<my username>\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState.
Still, how was I to get the actual files? Again, StackExchange to the rescue! After reading a few more pages, as well as the WSL man pages, I learned that I could mount ext4.vhdl to a WSL distro using powershell $wsl -d Ubuntu-22.04 --mount --vhd <path to the VHD>
After some supplemental reading to make sure I wouldn't break things even more, I was able to load WSL and find the drive in /mnt/wsl. I carefully transferred all of my files over to a new device and retired for the day.

Lessons Learned:
-ESD happens. Don't become careless.
-If you're on Windows, your device storage is probably encrypted by BitLocker. Keep track of your bitlocker key. It can probably be found at your microsoft.com account.
-Backup your data. It's said that the effectiveness of a data backup plan is unknown until one attempts to actually recover backed up data

Over the past year, I had been using WSL more and more for its convenience compared to Powershell. Now seemed like a good time to make the switch to using Linux as my desktop OS. I'm now using Ubuntu full-time and much prefer it to Windows + WSL.
